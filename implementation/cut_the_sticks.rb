     string = "( Theres a lot of strange ways of passing time in the middle of nowhere.

Shooting cans, swimming in cattle tanks, and a plethora of other redneck ideas my girlfriend had been teaching me of all summer. I was from a big, bustling city up north. She was from a small town that no one besides me had ever ended up in on purpose. Wed met in college some years before, and after we graduated we both had a hard time finding a decent job in the current economy. It was her idea to move back to her hometown.

     Living expenses there were a lot cheaper, shed said, and her parents had an empty guest house we could rent out. It took a bit of convincing, but eventually I swallowed my pride and agreed. It seemed to turn out better than I could have expected. She got a job as a waitress at a nice cafe in town. I was able to secure an IT job where I could work from home. The pay wasnt great, but it went a lot further in the small town than it had in the city.

     It was the hottest part of summer when she first suggested we go fire watching. I was entirely confused - and slightly concerned - as to what fire watching entailed. There had been a series of wildfires around the town recently. No loss of life or damage to property yet, and she informed me that such a thing happened every year. The dry brush we were surrounded by made it all too easy for fires to start. She then explained fire watching as we were heading to my truck. Basically, you hear about a wildfire, and you drive out to a nice safe distance, and then watch it. Usually no more than less than entertaining entertainment, the locals justified it by explaining that if they were watching it, they could help out if there ended up being any need. Evacuating animals, carrying buckets of water, that type of thing. I asked if that usually ended up happening.

      Well, not really. But better safe than sorry, right?  She said, grabbing a fire blanket and some animal harnesses. Id been there long enough to not bother to argue, at that point, so I just picked up the plastic bucket she told me to grab and followed her outside. It wasnt like I was going to do anything else that evening anyways, so why not join the brigade of nosy neighbors turned fire watchers.

     Nearly a month later, I found myself fire watching for the third time. It was actually somewhat fun - the looming sense of adventure or danger without anything ever actually happening. I also worried that meant my redneck level was increasing. We piled into my pickup truck with our normal blanket and buckets. I still wasnt quite sure why we bothered to bring buckets - it wasnt like a few half gallons of water would do much against a brush fire. Our target fire that night was a good few miles from town, out in the dark depths of the local foothills. We werent able to get more than a few hundred feet away from it, and we eventually settled on pulling partially down an old access road so that we faced the action in the valley below. We pulled off into the ditch slightly on the off chance that any cars did come down the road, the back of our car facing the empty expanse of dirt road behind us. I rolled down my window as Sarah shut the engine off.

     Opening that window was what opened the door to our survival, for it was the smell that first put me on alert. It was sickening - fundamentally wrong. Repulsive in an overwhelming, hard programmed way. Even without knowing where it came from, it sent waves of nausea and revolt coursing through my body, culminating in a feeling of impending doom.

     I glanced over at my girlfriend to see her wrinkling her nose. There was an anxious flicker in her gaze.

      What is that?  She asked. I shook my head.

      God, its awful.  I said. I began to twist around in my seat to pull the back window of the pickup truck shut. Thats when the flicker of light caught my eye. I paused, squinting in hopes of making out what it was. It seemed to rapidly be growing bigger, flickering all the while. At first I thought it was a car, but that didnt account for the flashing. Some sort of emergency vehicle - a fire truck, maybe - crossed my mind. I elbowed Sarah.

      Do you see that?  I asked, pointing out the light. It had probably doubled in size from a small speck to a bug-sized blob at this point.

      Yeah. Maybe we should pull over more.  She said. I nodded, an uneasy feeling sitting in my stomach. Something about it - the light, the flickering, the speed - it just didnt feel right. I continued to stare at it, and thats when I noticed the smell getting stronger.

      Is it possible the smell’s coming from that?  I asked. She shrugged, wrinkling her nose once more.

      Maybe. Man, I wouldnt wanna smell it up close then.

     It was even bigger now, and I could begin to make out a shape. It was close to turning the corner onto our stretch of the access road. Horror washed over me as it came into focus. It was a fire truck - or rather, a truck on fire. Not in any way that should have been possible, though. It wasnt just a blazing engine. The entire thing was consumed in flames, as if made from fire. Strange, sharp solid shapes stuck out from it at random angles. Like the smell - which was now overwhelming - the entire thing felt wrong at its core.

      Holy-  Sarah said.

      We need to leave.  I said quietly. She nodded silently, seeming to share the feeling of dread that I felt. She quickly turned, scrambling to turn the engine on. Our truck roared to life, and I swear the fire truck began to speed up upon seeing the sign of life. It rounded the corner faster than should have been possible.

      Go, go, go!  I shouted, unable to turn my eyes from the burning metallic monster. It was nearly upon us now, and it was even more terrifying up close. The solid shapes revealed themselves to be charred bones, seemingly melting out of - or into - the all-consuming fire. I was quite sure they werent all animal bones, and for some reason my mind supplied that they belonged to the victims of this demonic truck. Behind the dirt glass windshield, which was somehow held up by the flames, there was an even worse sight. A man - or what was once a man - sat in the drivers seat. His face was obscured by one of those old fashioned fire masks, his eyes shining red from within it like glowing embers.

     I think I screamed at that point, and Sarah finally threw the car into gear. We roared out the ditch. I was still screaming for her to go faster. She tried to glance over at the mirror at one point to see what had me so petrified, and her face grew paler when she did. I have to hand it to her though - her knuckles grew white around the steering wheel but her driving didnt waver. I probably would have been in such a panic driving I would have crashed the car. We sped around the corner so quickly we thumped back onto the ground. The fire truck sped after us, the corner barely slowing it down. It remained hot on our tail, and it was quickly gaining on us. I dared a glance at the speedometer, only to find we had almost topped it out already. The fire truck showed no signs of slowing, and was quickly closing the distance between us. Our car roared faster, the engine straining as Sara quite literally put the pedal to the metal. It was nearly upon us, and I have no doubt we would have been consumed in the screaming flames if not for the car on the side of the road.

     I barely saw it in time to yell for Sara to watch out. She pulled hard on the steering wheel to narrowly miss it. Time seemed to slow down. The couple inside stared at us in confusion. I tried to warn them. I really did. I pounded on the window as we sped by, shouting at them to join us in our desperate attempt to flee. The confusion on their faces doubled, and then turned to horror as their eyes followed where I was pointing. Then, we sped by. Time started up again. The fire truck, like us, veered, only in the opposite direction. Right into the car. There was an explosion of light and heat. I let out a sob. Sarah gave a horror struck glance into the mirror, her grip on the steering wheel growing tighter.

     We didnt slow down. There was nothing we could do for them, and we werent about to wait around until the demonic truck was no longer distracted. We kept our pace - eons the speed limit - all the way home. I was amazed we werent pulled over. Then I remembered the majority of the police force was probably out fighting the fire.

     When we pulled into the driveway, neither of us moved. After a moment, Sarah shut off the engine
      I thought it was jus®t a legend,  she said quietly.

     I slowly turned to face her, twisting against my seat belt.

      What? You knew about...that thing?  I asked, a sharper edge to my tone than I intended.

      No! I had no idea it was real. But theres an old story around town.  She said. She took a deep breath. I thought she wouldnt continue for a moment.

      Back in the 50s, there was a horrible brush fire. The type that lasted days, if not weeks. The town had an even smaller firefighting force back then - just one old truck. Three of the veteran firefighters were called out to the blaze in the middle of the night. They were making some headway, and then the wind picked up. The fire started growing real fast - roaring flame, the whole deal. They realized they were in over their heads and tried to retreat. But the old truck couldnt outrun the flames. None of them survived, and the legend said that the burnt truck, driven by their ghosts, still haunts the desolate country roads to this day. Looking for more victims.

Shed started crying in the middle of the tale, tears flowing freely down her face. I regretted my accusation.

      That sounds like any old ghost story,  I said.  You had no way of knowing it was true.

She gave a small nod. Then we silently headed inside, neither of us quite knowing what to say next. The smell of burning leaves faintly filled the air.
